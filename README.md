# Connect-four-game
It is a website to replicate the famous connect 4 game. Connect four chips in order to win! (This is just the front end part so will not include any leader board or will not remember scores of a particular player. Thanks) 
The rules are simple:-
  1. The current player chooses a coloumn and then the chip drops to the bottom-most available emtpy slot
  2. Same thing is repeated with the other player and this goes on turn by turn until someone gets 4 chips next to each other in a row    coloumn or diagonally. 
The first person to connect four chips wins!
